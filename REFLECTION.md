# Reflection on Developing Personal Profile using HTML/CSS

## Introduction
The main aim of this project is to bring our Figma-designed personal profile to life by coding it in HTML and CSS. This means taking the visual layout, colors, typography, and components created in Figma and replicating each element in code to match the design as closely as possible. In addition to accurately styling the profile, we were also tasked with making it responsive. This involves using flexible layouts, media queries, and CSS techniques that ensure the design adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizesâ€”from desktops to mobile devices. This project enhances our practical understanding of
translating a static design into a dynamic, functional webpage, highlighting the process 
of front-end development and responsive design in web development.

## What I Learned
This project highlighted Figma's flexibility, allowing precise control and immediate visual feedback. Translating the design into HTML and CSS has deepened my understanding of HTML structure and CSS properties like flexbox, grid, and styling techniques. Navigating HTML/CSS limitations boosted my creativity and skills in layout and styling.

## Challenges Faced and Overcomed
Building this profile page presented several challenges, primarily in achieving **responsive design**. Adapting the layout across devices required experimenting with `flexbox`, `grid`, and media queries, which gradually improved my skills in creating adaptive designs. 

**Aligning images and text** within sections, like the footer, was another hurdle. Balancing visual appeal and functionality meant adjusting padding, margins, and image sizes, allowing me to match my original Figma design.

Additionally, integrating **Font Awesome** icons required linking the library correctly and minimizing load times. After some research, I streamlined this process effectively.

Finally, working with **complex HTML and CSS structures** proved challenging. Organizing nested elements, like images and buttons, was initially overwhelming. By breaking down sections and adding comments, I managed to keep my code organized and maintainable.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
My strength in this project was my dedication to meeting deadlines, allowing me to manage time effectively and tackle challenges with persistence. Although I struggled with coding image elements, I saw it as a learning opportunity, researching techniques to improve my skills for future projects.

## Future Improvements
Moving forward, I plan to manage my time more efficiently by setting clear goals and avoiding procrastination. I will focus on completing tasks early, allocating time for research and review to ensure quality. I also aim to develop greater independence, relying more on my own abilities to build confidence and grow.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has significantly enhanced my understanding of front-end development, particularly in translating Figma designs into responsive HTML/CSS. Despite challenges like responsive design and integrating external libraries, I gained valuable skills in layout, styling, and problem-solving. Moving forward, I aim to improve my time management, independence, and coding abilities for more efficient and high-quality work.
